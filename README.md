## About
The Geodesy Markup Language (GeodesyML) is a standard way of describing (encoding) and sharing geodetic data and metadata. In the same way people from all over the world speak different languages, so do geodesists; for example, some people use the term 'GNSS station' and others use the term 'GNSS site'. GeodesyML is a common language. By mapping your database to GeodesyML, when your data is shared with others, it is easy for the user to discover and combine with other data. For more information, please visit www.geodesyml.org.

## Documentation

GeodesyML [GitHub Pages](http://geoscienceaustralia.github.io/GeodesyML) contain
HTML documentation with diagrams for GeodesyML and all supporting schemas.

*Note:* `gh-pages` branch is very large, so to clone this repository and bring down only `master` branch, use:

```
git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/GeoscienceAustalia/GeodesyML
```

You can later fetch the branches you are interested in using:

```
git remote set-branches --add origin branch-1 branch-2
git fetch origin
```
