Log2xml python package is a schema based GNSS site log file
parser and GeodesyML XML writer.

Log2xml relies on PYXB for schema valiation and
XML writing.

        1. eGeodesy.py     # PYXB binding
        2. iso3166.py      # country code
        3. log2xml.py      # parser and writer
        4. logging.conf    # logging configuration

PYXB 1.2.5 (http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/index.html)
which requires Python version 2.6 or higher including 3.x,
need to be installed, and with bundle generated.

Limited by PYXB's capabilities, following GeodesyML's schemas
have to be modified locally.

        1. equipment.xsd
        2. geodesyML.xsd
        3. geodeticEquipment.xsd
        4. geodeticMonument.xsd
        5. monumentInfo.xsd

The modified set of schemas are in the GIT repository.
